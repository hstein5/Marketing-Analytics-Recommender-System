# Marketing-Analytics-Recommender-System

## Background
Pernalonga, a leading supermarket chain of over 400 stores in Lunitunia, sells over 10 thousand products in over 400 categories.  Pernalonga regularly partners with suppliers to fund promotions and derives about 30% of its sales on promotions.  While a majority of its promotion activities are in-store promotions, it recently started partnering with select suppliers to experiment on personalized promotions.  In theory, personalized promotions are more efficient as offers are only made to targeted individuals who required an offer to purchase a product.  In contrast, most in-store promotions make temporary price reductions on a product available to all customers whether or not a customer needs the incentive to purchase the product.  The efficiency of personalized promotion comes from an additional analysis required on customer transaction data to determine which customers are most likely to purchase a product to be offered in order to maximize the opportunity for incremental sales and profits.

## Problem
Your analytics consulting firm was selected by Pernalonga (the client) to develop a marketing campaign to experiment on personalized promotions.  While the details of specific partnerships with suppliers to fund the experimental personalized promotions are still being negotiated, you have received data from the client.  You have two weeks to analyze the data to support the proposed marketing campaign below (assigned according to your group number) that is scheduled to run for two weeks in April 2020.

Colgate-Palmolive is interested in a promotional campaign to boost the sales of Colgate toothpaste.

A minimum requirement is to provide (with justification) a personalized promotion plan with the following:
- The customers that will be targeted
- For each targeted customer, which product is being promoted with an offer

Not required, but a plus for your firm (bonus points to you) if your plan includes the following information:
- The expected total redemption cost for the promotion (total discounts redeemed)
- The expected incremental volume for each product
